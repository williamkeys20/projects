This assignment is autograded using the Python unittest library and GitHub Actions. Submission is handled using GitHub Classrooms, and all submissions are collected through commits to your homework repositories. Each assignment will have its own repository and all repositories can be found under our class organization on GitHub.
- To find a guide on how to submit GitHub Classroom assignments, check out our homework from the second day `jump-python-homework-02`
- Do not change any included unittest. This can cause autograding to fail and will delay grading your assignments
- The autograding will execute all cells first, so make sure there are no loose function calls that require input.
- All edits should be done between the `### BEGIN SOLUTION` and `### END SOLUTION` tags
